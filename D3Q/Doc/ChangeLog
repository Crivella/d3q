v 1.0.7
* nasty bug in d3_tk.x, CGP calculation, wrong prefactor!
* added calculation of JDOS and RMS of atomic displacements to d3_r2q.x
* better threatmenet of LO-TO along paths
* support for random grids improved (should work in SMA)

v 1.0.6
* nasty bug in d3_qq2rr.x where the 3rd order matrix would not be read correctly has been fixed: PLEASE REGENERATE THE FORCE CONSTANT FILES!!

v 1.0.5
* tiny fix on the previous version (symmetrization removed for scattering modes as it is not necessary and does not respect detailed balance, i.e. possible funny results with small grids)
* fixed a bug when using MPI parallelism and isotopes (isotopes would be ignored on CPUs after the first one)

v 1.0.4
* one important change: quantities (linewidth, self-energy, scattering matrices, velocities) pertaining to degenerate phonon modes are now averaged out. This prevents broken symmetry when doing thermal conductivity calculations.

v 1.0.3
* fixed a case where a fuction result was used in an openmp reduce clause, causing segmentation fault on some intel compilers
* removed a mention of a non-existing unused subroutine, causing some compilers to rightfully complain
* not using vdCos and vdSin with intel compiler made easier (remove -D__HASVTRIG from thermal2/Makefile)
* openmp no more enable by default (it was actually unintended )

v 1.0.2
* fixed old style namelist in tutorial example input file (and fixed code to still read those)

v 1.0.1
* remove line from PROGRAM_sparse.f90 that prevented compilation (thanks S. Appalakondaiah for reporting)
* calculation of 3-body force constant now done in two passess (100x times faster)
* 3d order acoustic sum rule now imposed in-place (faster and much lower memory usage)

v 1.0
everything!
