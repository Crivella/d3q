   mode='full'
! mode can be one of the following:
!   * "gamma-only" : compute the D3 matrix of (0,0,0)
!   * "gamma-q"    : compute the matrix at (0,-q,q), like the old d3.x code; you have
!                    to specify the point after the namelist (units of 2pi/alat)
!   * "single"     : compute a single triplet (q1,q2,q3), you will have to specify q1 and q2 points,
!                    on two separate lines, after the namelist (units 2pi/alat); q3 is just -(q1+q2)
!   * "partial"    : compute a full grid around a specific point q0: (q0, q0+q, q0-q)
!                    you will have to specify the point (2pi/alat) and then, on a 
!                    new line,  the size of the grid (nqx nqy nqz)
!   * "full"       : compute a full grid of q1 and q2 points, q3=-(q1+q2) you will have
!                    to specify the size of the grid after this namelist (nqx nqy nqz)
   prefix = 'MoS2b'
! prefix must be the same as in the pw.x and ph.x 
   fild3dyn = 'FILD3DYN/anh'
! prefix of the file names where D3 matrices will be saved
   ethr_ph = 1.d-8
! threshold to solve Sterb-Heimer equations, do not exagerate, it should be in the same
! order as the one obtained in phonon, i.e. the "thresh" in these lines
!
!      iter #   5 total cpu time :     0.3 secs   av.it.:   5.8
!      thresh= 1.541E-08 alpha_mix =  0.700 |ddv_scf|^2 =  7.224E-16
!
! At the *last* iteration.

   fildrho = 'auto:drho'
! fildrho must be the same as in ph.x, and it must be auto:something
! when doing a grid calculation (see phonon manual for details)

! If you only want to compute a subset of the q-point use the following variables:
   first=10
   last=50
   offset=20
   step=8
! This will compute one point every 8 (with an offset of 2) between 10 and 50, i.e. 
! 12, 20, 28, 36, and 44
! Note that you can run several simultaneous instances of d3.x in the same directory
! and with the same prefix as long as they work on different q-points.
!

   restart=.true.
! do no repeat calculations if you find the corresponding fild3dyn
! Restart of partially-computed q-points is currenlty implemented but disabled as
! still unreliable. You can activate it modifying the code AT YOUR OWN RISK!

   !degauss=0.03d0
! You can change the k-points grid and smearing used in d3q

! q-point coordinate, or grid specification have to be specified here, these are some examples:
! "gamma-q" case, compute the M point:
 0.5 0.0 0.0
! "single" case, compute M,X,-M-X
 0.5 0.0 0.0
 0.333333 0.333333 0.0
! "partial" case, compute 4x4x1 a grid centered around M
 0.5 0.0 0.0
 4 4 1
! "full" case, compute a 4x4x1 grid
 4 4 1
