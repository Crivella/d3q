Two examples about the d3 calculations, in both we compuet the full doule-grid dispersion fo anharmonice constants:
MoS2     : lots of comments in the input files
Graphene : just a few comments

In the Tutorial2016 directory you will find the exercise from the
Psi-K Quantum-ESPRESSO School on Ab-Initio Thermal Transport
hosted in Paris in June 2016. The exercises include verbose comments
and explanations.

We recommend that you reproduce the exercises in the Tutorial in order
to familiarise with the D3Q and thermal2 codes. If you are already familiar 
with Quantum-ESPRESSO calculation you may want to skip DAY1 (total energy
calculation) and DAY2 (phonon calculation and interpolation).
